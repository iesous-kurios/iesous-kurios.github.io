I work for a non-profit, Family Promise of Spokane.  We provide shelter and services for families experiencing homelessness.  I am a student at Lambda in their Data Science program.  I have been blessed to be able to apply everything I am learning directly into my job duties.  Any insights I gain from using data science at work directly works to benefit the lives of families with children who are experiencing homelessness in Spokane County.
